// This ray offsetting method is inspired by the "A Fast and Robust Method for Avoiding Self-Intersection"
// article from the Ray Tracing Gems book. The original implementation from that article was found to be
// flawed in multiple ways, but the logic behind it is solid.
//
// When we hit a triangle and compute a position on that triangle from the vertices and the barycentrics,
// the resulting position is inexact, it has some error. You can think of that as a "cloud" of points
// around the triangle plane, and the position can be anywhere inside that cloud, on either side of
// the triangle. In order to avoid self-intersection, we need to apply an offset along the triangle's
// geometric normal that is larger in magnitude than the thickness of this error cloud.
// The magnitude of this error depends primarily on the magnitude of the vertex positions, IOW,
// the further away our triangle is from the world origin, the larger the error will be.
//
// So, we take the maximum magnitude of the position and multiply it by some constant.
// This is different from the code in the RTG article which was dealing with position components
// independently, but that just distorts the normal direction for most triangles, and fails
// on triangles that are coplanar to one of the major planes like Y=0 in particular.
//
// The reason why dealing with per-component errors fails on triangles coplanar to a major plane
// is apparently in the ray intersection math that is happening inside the GPU. At least the approach
// documented in the Vulkan ray tracing spec (*) is based on transforming the primitive positions to
// ray space, which involves multiplying the positions by a matrix. That matrix propagates
// the error from reconstructing the X and Z positions (in case of Y=0 plane) into the ray T.

// Calculates the *scaled* approximate error of a float32 position.
// The error is scaled by the 1/kFloatULP constant defined in the calculateRayOffset(...) function,
// which is moved there for efficiency: we don't want to do extra multiplications when combining
// errors from different positions.
// This function should be used on every position value in the chain of transforms, like so:
//
//   float error = calculatePositionError(objectSpacePosition);
//   float3 worldSpacePosition = mul(objectToWorld, objectSpacePosition);
//   error = max(error, calculatePositionError(worldSpacePosition));       <-- update the error
//   ...
//   float3 offset = calculateRayOffset(error, triangleNormal);
//   float3 rayOrigin = worldSpacePosition + offset;
//

  const float maxAbsComponent = max(abs(p.x), max(abs(p.y), abs(p.z)));

// This function calculates a ray offset in the direction of the normal, given the error 
// previously computed with the calculatePositionError(p) function above.
// If the offset point is desired on the "inside" of a surface (for example when dealing 
// with translucency or double sided geometry), invert the normal passed in beforehand.

  // but that is hard to believe because that's just 1 ULP of float32. At the same time, the article
  // was effectively multiplying the normal by 1 / 32768.0 with some cryptic integer math, and that
  // is often too large.
